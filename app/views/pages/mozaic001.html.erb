			The first of the Mozaics! Mozaic is the project name for the tile engine that I am working on. This version obviously a Java Applet and this specific instance is a test of the render speed of my scheduler and active rendering. The same applet running on this screen is wrapped in a JFrame that you can download from <a href="/applets/mozaic-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar">here</a> and run. Happy Rendering.

h1. Notes for this page

This is the finish of render test 1 - I know it has some issues in that applet on scrolling and moving the browser around but they are just me being lazy (the render buffer is a buffered image and it can be recycled any time - I should create it every render loop);

* I am using the Fast Mersenne Twister Implementation. You can find the software on the authors page <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~naras/programs/">here</a> and its licence is in its header.
* I am not using it in this test, but my jar contains <a href="http://j3d.org/">the Java3D</a> implementation for Perlin Noise. Its licence is in the linked header.
* Sadly, <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> is a trademark of <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>.
* The source for the applet and this page are not open (yet). If you want it for any reason then drop me a line.
