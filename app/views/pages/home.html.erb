h1. Meet plural.cc

"plural.cc":http://plural.cc is the ongoing effort to create a single and managed location to host projects (specifically my projects). This site hosts my source code, run instances of my projects and host other peoples projects that are in their infancy where they are of interest to me.

h1. Whats New? 20120129

Mozaic the tile engine is moving very fast right now. Its scheduler is completed and you can see a rendering test based on scheduled tasks "here":/pages/mozaic001.html. I am very happy with how its performing and quite interested in progressing it for the moment.

I am also very pleased to announce you can check out the source code for "Mozaic":https://bitbucket.org/jmarsden/mozaic/src! (no pun intended). The source should remain open from now on - I have added the licences I needed to and I have got over the fact the code is not so clean. Let me know if you find any of it interesting.

*P.S. You and find the "old-new stuff":/pages/updates here.*

div(info). Please bear with me; "plural.cc":http://plural.cc is under development. It is a slow and on-going effort. I desire a variety of functionality and generally implement it as I need it. I am working on making the different services look similar. If you have any suggestions then drop me a line.
