Mozaic the tile engine is moving very fast right now. Its scheduler is completed and you can see a rendering test based on scheduled tasks "here":/pages/mozaic001.html. I am very happy with how its performing and quite interested in progressing it for the moment.

I am also very pleased to announce you can check out the source code for "Mozaic":https://bitbucket.org/jmarsden/mozaic/src! (no pun intended). The source should remain open from now on - I have added the licences I needed to and I have got over the fact the code is not so clean. Let me know if you find any of it interesting.

Added Perlin Noise Terrain (HTML5)! This is an exercise in algorithmics and playing with Perlin Noise.

Added Perlin Noise Generator (HTML5) based on my implementation of 2D Perlin Noise. Play with the settings and see what intersting patterns can be generated.

I have decided on a "web framework":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework (as of the 20110826). This site is currently built using "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ which has forced me to quickly pick up some "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/. The content markup is being done by the awesome "RedCloth":http://redcloth.org/faq textile package. "CakePHP":http://cakephp.org and "Grails":http://grails.org/ are closer than I realised to Rails making it an easy transistion. I am using "a hack based on rvm":http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/21-rvm-and-passenger-setup-for-rails-2-and-rails-3-apps to run a single instance of "Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ in Apache and concurrently host Rails 3.0 (plural.cc) and Rails 2.11 (projects.plural.cc). The downside is that I am stuck on Ruby 1.8.7 for everything (which is currently not an issue). I can now start figuring out implementations of the various bits of functionality I desire.

While I am figuring that out you can check out "JSONiJ":http://jsonij.plural.cc, do a bit of development on "Kinetic":https://github.com/openecho/Kinetic3 with me or help me figure out how I make a "game server":http://projects.plural.cc/projects/gameserver.
